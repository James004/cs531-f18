   This class will focus on the complete understanding of the
   hypertext transfer protocol (http) and the implementation of a
   web server. The class will be programming intensive: prerequisites
   include the understanding of network (socket) programming. The
   student will implement an http server, with five assignments
   that demonstrate protocol conformance. The assignments will build
   on the previous assignments, and at the end of the class the
   student should have a fully functioning web server that implements
   most of the common http functionality.

   The students will decide their own implementation language within
   the Unix/Liniux environment; the lectures will be strictly about
   http and not about any particular programming language. There
   will be no class textbook; class lectures and RFCs will be the
   primary guide for students. Grades will be determine solely on
   the design and performance of the http servers.

Prerequisites: Unix/Linux, knowledge of socket programming.

Attendance Policy: Attendance is required for class participation,
presentation, and discussion.  Absences must cleared with the instructor
prior to class.  You are responsible for everything that is said, 
discussed, and presented during class.


Grading: 

   The class grade will consist of 5 Assignments of 20 points each.
   Each assignment will be demoed in class.  Late assignments lose 3
   points for every 24 hours they are late unless prior arrangements are
   made with the intstuctor.  Readings and assignment descriptions will
   be released on a rolling basis during the semester.
